    I miss [redacted]. I wish i could go back to skyway, i thought things were bad there but i had no idea, [redacted] was there, and [redacted]. People didn't hate me. I had a lot of friends. People cared about me. Normally I would be fine with the way things are now but without her it's harder than I thought it would be. Most of the time i dont give a shit about [redacted], that was all his fault. How quick he was to cut me out without even being nice enough to confront me himself or hear my side of the story shows how little he cared about me. I don't need people like that in my life. I've done shitty things but I don't think I deserve that. Living my life is enough of a punishment, which sucks because I know I have nothing to be sad about. The people I had were gone for a long time, I should be over it. I don't know why I'm not.

    I learned a new word today. "Toska. Its a russian word. No English word translates all of its shades. Melancholy, longing, sadness...” 
    Maybe I can turn this in as an essay. I want to make a show, like a Home Movies type thing. I miss Home Movies. I learned Toska from Home Movies.I wish I could go back in time and see what the world was like when it was still intact. I’m enjoying $uicideboy$ more than I ever thought I would, mostly Magazine from Radical $uicide. Having a friend over is like hosting a party, you have fun for a day/night and everything is great for that amount of time until they leave. Then it's just an empty home and there's nothing to do but clean everything up and sit and think about how bleak everything is… I think I need a hug. “...the hideous lonely emptiness of existence... nothingness. The predicament of man forced to live in a barren godless eternity, like a tiny flame flickering in an immense void with nothing but waste, horror, and degradation forming a useless bleak straightjacket in a black, absurd, cosmos.”-

    Most good days have bad endings, not today though. Which is good. I found my other gun. I really don’t like how american it is but I still like it, which should tell you how good it is. I eat way too much ramen. I noticed that I’ve been forgetting how to spell, mostly messing up my tops with tos. I wish POS was still making music, he may be a shitty person but he still makes good music. I don’t care what kind of person you are, music is music, if you make good music I’ll still enjoy it.

        Another good night. Orange juice, bacon and Walking Dead. I gotta say, I love how involved Negan is. What he did to Glenn was pretty shitty but idk how anyone can hate someone this fukin badass. Mob Dylan released a new song. I'm glad Mouthe is doing new stuff, especially stuff that’s heavier and less “lofi”, don’t get me wrong, I love lofi but his heavy music is amazing. Anyways, I’m gonna enjoy the rest of this night watching the Walking Dead and sipping orange juice.
    
    :Rained The Whole Night (Nicolas Jaar Remix):</p>
    
      <p>  Today sucked massive balls. Constant dissociation, reminders of loneliness, thoughts of school. Idk what's wrong with me, and i dont think I'll ever find out. I don't even know if I want to know what's wrong with me. If I know I might try to fix it, trying leads to failing, failing leads to pain, and pain leads to trying to fix it. The cost of happiness is loss of reality. I know what's real but I'm always in a shell being blocked from the world, and that shield could stop being transparent at any moment. But being a shield, it blocks sensations, or at least distorts them. I walked outside today, but the wind didn't feel normal. I know it was normal but it's like I was seeing the trees move in one direction, while the wind blew in the other, or seeing the world move backwards through time, walking forwards but feeling the wind at your back. Idk what to do. I want to stop feeling like this but i also think i'll hate it if i do. I miss [redacted], no one can replace her. Even if someone could, they wouldn't want to because it would involve being close to me. What we had will never be the same with anyone else. I feel like it was my fault but she didn't talk to me either, if i was really that special to her she would've.
    
    :Wasting Time:</p>
    
  <p>  It doesnt matter
    Nothing matters
    It was a day
    A shitty day
    And thats how itll always be
    shitty.
    Everything hur ts
    But everythig is gone
    I have nothing
    I dont wanna be alone anymore but i dont want to be abandoned by everyone i end up caring about
    I keep working towards some goal that always gets obliterated as soon as its in arms reach
    If it always gets taken from me, when whats the point of trying to get it
    I wanna be free
    But freedom isnt even real
    Its a made up word people use because they think ut has meaning
    “Its a free country”
    If it was free it would be an anarchy
    It doesnt matter tho
    Nothing does
    I dont know why i bother trying to help myself when all of the time im taking will be wasted one day
    So im gonna be shitty
    If people are gona treat me like shit then i get to do the same
    But i care about other people
    I shouldnt
    But i do
    I care about the people that dont even think about me anymore
   [redacted]
    They probably dont remember me
    And they shouldnt
    I didnt matter tothem nearly as much as they did to me
    Which is fine
    They have people that care about them
    My family broke the trust i spent 12 years building
    Thrice
    And the ones that didnt break that trust are hundreds of miles away
    Why am i doing this
    I want to leave
    12/15/21
    :Feels Like Summer
    (2023 me, this is fucking edgy.)</p>
    
    
    <p>So im still thinking about all of those people, ive been considering suicide a lot more lately as well. I dont even want to doe really, i just want the pain to be gone but i know that i wouldnt like it because im not used to it being that way so i just have to deal wih how my life is right now.i dont sleep during the day anymore, ive tried to fx it but cant for some reason. Everything before right now is still a blur. I want to write a book but im not sure what it would be about, every attempt ive made to write anything ended with me not knowing what to write or how to continue the story in a good way.the last of us HBO (wrting this on jan 27 23, its out and its perfect) will hopefully come out sometime fairly son, nick offerman is bill which is almost as perfect as bryan cranston and aaron paul as ww ad jp. Dying light sucks balls.i want to talk to [redacted] but i feel like that thing happened where if i wait too long to do something i really want to do, i dont really want to do it anymore. Which sucks. A lot.[redacted] hasnt responded in two days so ig shes gone now too, along with [redacted] who hasnt responded in like 2-3 weeks.
    I feel really stuck. I want to talk but i have no one to talk to. I want to leave but :Too Late:theres nowhere to go. I want to eat but im not hungry enough to have the motivation to cook anything.i want to read but cant focus. I want to die but i dont want people to be hurt. Thats the big one. I want to be gone but theres no way to do it without hurting people, people that apparently care about me.maybe this could be my book, jut pring out this doc and give it a name like “diary of some random douche youll never meet because hes a lonely tard” or something. It would probably sell like shit.anyone that read it would probably think something along the lines of “lmao, edgy prick.”. I am kind of an asshole. People give me everything but when they slip up it feels like im the towers on 9/11. I dont know why.walter whit a is a dick. The real protagonists of breaking bad are skinny pete and badger, we need a spin off show about them.i took some pictures in the back patio because im in oregon now. Doesnt really make sense but anyways, i used an old digital camera i got from someone like a lot of years ago.it takes pretty good pictures for a $20 camera from 2010. [redacted] added me to her private snapchat thing which is pretty sick since im in love with her or whatever. Not sure what love is supposed to feel like as an asexual but i have a good feeling that this is it. But we play dbd sometimes. Rarely, but still, its also pretty sick. Anyways im done for noe.
    
    :Too Late:</p>

    <h2>2022</h2>
    
   <p> WHADDUP BITCH? life is still boring. Less, but still boring. I drew a dick on [redacted]'s arm, she was warm. I've never felt someone's warmth before, it was nice. Besides me being a total fucking dumbass and "falling in love" with people I've known for a week nothing has happened. I almost ate Szechuan beef while watching Rick and Morty WGICH WOULDVE BEEN PERFECT, but I was too lazy to bring the box back downstairs when I was done so I figured I just wouldn't take it upstairs. Dank nature. Idk why I love that so much. Dank nature. The perfect word combination. Speaking of which, night in the woods was amazing, but kind of depressing. I don't get why people thought mae was a bitch, does that make me a bitch? Probably. Everyone knew that already, it's in every username I use. Rname. I keep getting random body pains, so that's cool. Is this what it's like to be old? Just laying down and boom, sharp abdomen pain. I'm glad I deleted those photos of those middle aged white guys. It probably would've been really weird if I kept them, but I guess it was weird that I had them in the first place. Dank nature. Sharkle is my true love, idk who my dumbass brain thinks I'm supposed to be with, it's sharkle. I'm still asexual I think. The thing about being ace is that I don't know until I actually do the deed, but I don't want to do it because of the whole ace thing so I'll never know if I actually am
    Wait no
    That's not how that works
    It's based on attraction not how you feel doing it. Right.
    Dank nature.
    I think I like [redacted].
    I'm not completely sure because I'm starting to like everyone I've ever liked less and less. Idk, I don't feel the same about her as I did a week ago but I already miss the warmth. It's the first time someone else has ever felt like a real person. Before that it was just npcs, I'm one of them too. What decides what body my consciousness goes to? What gave me the life this body lives? Where does my consciousness go when I die? Who decides that too? All will be answered when it happens I guess, if I ever meet whatever god could exist (IF I meet them, I'm probably too much of an asshole to meet god, they'll just send me straight to hell). (I never finished the previous thought before going to hell). I wonder what made [redacted] decide to talk to me. Maybe it was the awkward eye contact. Or my hair. Everyone always says they like my hair so I must have cool hair. That doesn't really matter now I guess, what matters is that she talked to me, and now we're friends. And now what matters is how I deal with that. What do I do to keep the friendship going? Do I even have to try or do we just talk and it automatically keeps going? I don't make many friends, when I do they stop talking to me. I'm really light headed. [redacted] was too earlier. I wonder what it is. Ear infection? Who knows. I'd like it to stop now. When I meet friends I really like I start being more careful with what I do in life, anything that could cause injury and/or death I don't even think about, these people are too nice to lose, but I guess if be the one they lose, if they care about me. Jay asks a lot of questions, so I assume she cares a little bit. That's what I don't like about talking to people, I never know if anyone actually cares, the most they can do is tell me, but I still won't have a clue whether they do or not. Dank nature. Sharkle. Warm. I think the real question I need to ask right now is who I should choose, [redacted] or sharkle? Ik Jay is a long time away from ever being anything more than a friend (if that would ever even happen), but sharkle would never betray anyone. I'm, well, not exactly excited, but not not excited for Valentine's day. I know nothing will happen, because guys are supposed to be the ones that do the work an all, but I'll be happy just seeing her. It's an A day though so only for one period. Who knows if we'll even talk. I should stop thinking about her. If something happens, then something happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. There isn't much I can do within my comfort zone to nudge anything in any particular direction, so for now I just wait to see which direction is picked for me by whatever decision I don't make. Dank nature.

  <p>  Everyone in this entire school right now has a regular ass backpack. They planned this didn't they. They knew I wouldn't bring one, they made it so I fuck it up.
    
    [redacted] called me, that sucked, and it was on the 1 day that Jay wasn't there. She was here today tho, which was nice. Especially since we didn't have anything to do for physics, we just played games. Also I'm pretty sure her full name is [redacted] or something like that. She kept looking up at me when she laughed, [redacted] did that too. I don't want it to be how it was with [redacted]. Valentine's day is on Monday, I'm 100% sure it won't even be brought up in any conversations, which is fine. Why would [redacted] call me? Was it his mom? She's insane so I wouldn't be surprised if she was doing it to get back at me after like 8 months or however long I've gone without talking to them. Hopefully whoever it was doesn't do it again. I really don't want to have to talk to them. Maybe she hired a private detective to follow me around. I'm sure she'd do that. 
    
    Just watched 127 hours, I'm not sleeping tonight. Also, new Instagram notification. It's blue. Blue ones are messages usually. Nevermind, not a message. Honestly I don't really care when skweezy posts a new reel.
  </p>
  <p>  5/17/22
    
    i fucked up. its done with [redacted]. theres no chance of anything happening. i cant believe how happy she made me. she was just lying, she doesnt actually like being around me, no one does, i shouldve fucking seen that. people fucjing praise me and just leave, which probes that they dont actually care about me, because if they did they way they said they do theyd make some kind of effort to talkt to me. i keep making eye contavt with jay in class, even tho we dont talk anymore, she moved seats in physics so shes across the room instead of right next to me. whatever. we had our chance 
    
    
    to be friends and i fucked it up. she did too. she couldve done more than pretend to enjoy my company. fuck. fuck this. what am i foing here. this isnt my home, these arent my people. i dont belong here. why the fuck did i come out here? why odes everyone keep hurting me. i have [redacted] still. id like to say ill hopefully talk to stella more but i dont want to hope for anything. i had hope with jay and kayla and lily and fucking everyone and look where that got me. kenji asled if i had ever dated anyone and i said no, which is true, but no one has ever liked me back excalt for one person and i had to leave right agter i founf out. maybe i deserve this. this could be karma for everything i did. im just right back yo square one. i have nothing. again. im tired of being surrounded by these people. they just lie to make me feel better. except for sadie. she meant everything she said, i did too. but it fucking sucks when the only person that finally cares about you as much as you do for them is in another fucking country. i was so happy. i felt that warmth and everything was okay. but im cold now. everything is cold again. and the only heat source is thousands of miles away.
    
    i cant keep doing this. i cant stay here. im almost back to january again, which is the most terrifying thing ive ever felt
    it took 1 week for my life to fall apart, and another to take everything i had.
    
    i might ask [redacted] for weed, or if she has anything that could kill me ill take that instead. not for right now, just in case. when shit soaks further into the fan ill need a way out, i already have notes
    </p>
    
   <p> im done dealing with [redacted]'s bushit. every time i share something im excited about eith her se fucks it up and im done. /
   </p>
    
  <p>  WOOO i thikn i love [redacted], which sucks because they dont feel the same but since i told them they ve been making more of an ffort to talk to mei think. They responded with [redacted], which is probably e best way to respond to that, except for not being rejected, i really wish they did feel the same tho, i really want to be wit them, not even as partners really but even jut being in the same room and doing things with them outside of school since theyre transferring. I really do like them. I want to look at them, i could look at their eyes all day, and eye contact usually makes me very uncomfortable. I want to be around them, i was nt to lay with them, i wanna watch movies together and go places and do a ton of shit 24/7. I really wan to kiss them. Thir hands are really soft too, even for not being together i still get to touch them a lot, not in a weir way but like patting them or grabbing their hands and stuff like that, i relly like that, it makes them feel more real whn i can actually reach out and touch them, they still dont feel 100% real to me but no one does, theyre as real as they can be. I love being around them. I really dnot like doing anything without them, even tho everything i do is nothing. I wanna do nothing with them
    
    I really like [redacted]. I feel like im starting to like them less, i stil feel all the same things but not as strong, maybe its bc i see them so little now. Theyve been really busy, i asked them if they wanted to go ti the park today but they were too busy, i hope theyre not overworking themself, its summer, no one should be this busy right now.
    </p>

    <h2>2023</h2>

    <p>So its been a while. I started learning html today so i figured while i was being stupid i might as well go all out and turn this into a website. its jan 27th, 2023. I dont talk to most of my friends. J is in a few of my classes this year but so is their entire friend group, so we barely talk. M transferred. I still talk to the other j, who i havent mentioned here yet but its not like it matters because the names are redacted. I greened out twice in a week and ive hd dpdr ever since, that was in late september i think so i dont remember the last few months. I have panic attacks daily and i fainted yesterday. I had a recurring dream where i died so i do thigs that happened in the drem differently in case the dream was predicting the future. I made a new friend over winter break. I had actually known them for a while, we were in a class and had a group project together but just never talked until i think dec 28th. about a week after we started talking they moved across the country. We call every week and watch movies or tv together and theyre ging ot be visiting for spring break, along with the rest of my family. I carpool with someone else i havent mentioned here. We met over the summer and immediately clicked but we havent been talking much. After they strted school they met new people and just stopped talking to me. Ive sat along almost every day at lunch. They ignored me during panic attacks, made fun of me when B moved away, and then blamed me for our friendship dying. They did the worst things they possbly could and still called me a piece of shit. I think the worst part is when they apologised, they were still saying the worst shit about me while also saying they love me. So at this point it really doesnt matter to me if we talk anymore. S really ruined me. She was perfect and we really loved each other, but i thought about everything she did, how she keps leaving and just treating me horribly. She left me again on my birthday, that was te worst week of my life and it was her fault. I told her i didnt feel the same because of that and she said she hated me. A few months later on new years she apologized and asked me to take her back and i didnt know what to say. But thats over now. I have B, and theyve treated me better than anyone else ive ever known. The Last Of Us HBO came out, just the first 2 episodes as of today but theyre both better than i thought they could ever be, which was still really good. But it still feels weird watching them just because im so used to the games and that trailers for it. Ive been reading about this show for 3 years and now im watching it and it doesnt feel right. My family in another state moved out of their house. When i visited over the summer i realized how much i really loved that house. How much i love july there. It rains constantly in july and its so peaceful. I walked to the store while it was raining and it was the nicest walk ive ever been on. I miss that feeling. I miss that house. Even with all of this bullshit going on im still relatively happy. I feel like shit physically and im lonely but im not sad or anything. At least not right now. :Foolsong:</p>

<p>I doubt anyone will ever read this. Or even find it when its live. But itll always be out there. Maybe an alien will find it after the world ends.</p>

<p>I stopped dating enties a while back because i didnt really think there was a point. Now that i have actual plans for this ill probably start doing that again, as wel as copying every new entry on the site to the original google doc i was writing all of this in. So its 1/28//23 now. I am unbelievably bored. I made ne of those jar terrarium things and its sitting by my window. There isnt really much else to do. I'll probably put on the office or something because thats the only thing thts really been entertaining. Maybe some no mans sky or dbd or mk11 too, idk we'll see. It's weird tthink that i statd this 2 years ago because thats when my life became just kind of the same. I had just lost all of my friends except for L, who i still talk to sometimes. I hadn't gone to school for a while already so that wasnt new. All that ever really happened then were tiny tiny things that i don't really remember. Charlie was in my dream the other night, my old dog. It was horrifying because we thought he died in out house but it was actually my posessed grandma that ended up terrorizing us for some reason. Charlie ended up fine and i didnt have to put him down again in my dream. That was nice, seeing him again. I don't really remember much these days. The saturday before jan 15th i thought i was going to die that night. I thought i wasnt going to wake up on sunday and i had a relly bad panic attack because of it that night. I ended waking up though, in case you didnt notice. I dont remember anythng before that day though. Like i still know who i m and i remember some of the things that happened, especially big moments in my life. But generally i don't have much there before that. I guess i'm exaggerating a little. But when i try to remember things i have a really hard time. Especially if it happened after september. I literally dont remember anything that hapened in september. It mustve been really eventful. Hopefully ill start writing here more. I'd like to add a little bit more background about myself, like big events that defined me or whatever. I started the google doc as a way to vent thinking one day id be able to look back and see how much ive changed. But since i want to go all out stupid and upload this somewhere i figured i should probably explain things a little better since im not the only one thatd be reading this and i cant just refer to events that only i know about without leaving people clueless. So eventually ill add more about that but for now i dont really care enough to do that. pew pew pew. I'm so fucking bored. I remember writing about valentines ay last year. It's almost valentines day again. Last year in 3rd period everyone brought their bags of candy that people gave them and then there i was. J asked if no one got me anything and i just said yea snd she gave me a singular starburst. Somehow that hurt more than getting nothing. This year J wont be here to give me pity candy though. Just me and my emtpy lunch table, doing group projects by myself. God my health teacher keeps assigning group projects but no ones ever picked me for a group and we have like a day to do all of it since its suppsed to be more than one person but i cant get all of the work done in  day so i just never do it. The 26th was the end of the semester and i finished it with 35% in health. Isn't that peachy. I painted my nails red with model paint i found in my closet, it looks nice. My nails feel warm though. My fingers are sweaty because of that.</p>

<h2>1/30/23</h2>
  
<p>Today was the first day of the new semester. I said i wasnt really sad but im not happy either. Ive been thinking about killing myself a lot more since im not really here anyways. I keep tellig my psychology teacher that ill come into class for lunch but i always forget to because of the panic attacks. I almost fainted again a few times today. It gets easier the more it happens. One of the biggest things i was afraid of when i started feeling like this was that id start getting used to it. Im starting to get used to it. We started sex ed today. That was fucking awful. we moved seats today andinstead of going to the table in the back with all of the chairs up i went for the empty one directly in the front of the room. Im so tired. No one realizes how hard things are. No one ever asks me if im okay, they just get upset when they know im not. L knows how hard it is to be me but they still assumed the worst of me when i wasnt exactly what they wanted me to be. I still dont understand what their problem with me was. They fucking avoided me. They stopped tlking to me. When i was crying 2 feet away from them they fucking ignored me. But its still all my fault because they didnt like how i acted. This is who i am, they knew that from day one. A  bit of advice, no matter how shitty someone is you still have no idea what it takes for them to get out of bed every day. No one wakes up thinking theyre gonna be a piece of shit that day, they probably get up talking themselves out of another 5 minutes. I wake up talking myself out of jumping infront of a car, so if i seem a little moody maybe consider that. Consider the effort it takes to distract myself from suicidal thoughts and panic attacks and think about how i have to move my hands just to make sure im still in control of my body every 5 minutes. Think about how theres nowhere i want to be more than in the arms of someone across thefucking country. I leave origami all around my school. It probably just gets thrown away, but i alwys like to make it because its something to focus on and maybe someone will be having a bad day and find a floer i left at their desk and feel better. I dont talk to anyone at school, but what i make is a part of me and if people keep that then part of me is alwys with them. I just tried to fold an origmi wasp for about an hour and a half, its 101 am, im goig to bed.</p>

<p>Dank Nature.
  2/2/23
The last few days have been uneventful. Theres a new seating chart in english and its actually really good. I st next to the only person i talk to in the whole school and were at the very back of the class. We watched south park on my computer today, the episode where cartman shits on garrisons desk. The only thing i dont like is that i had a lucid dream where i sat in the exact spot and it didnt end well, but thats okay. i had a dream last night that i was in  weird zombie apocalyse thing. I was in a hose in the woods with some people and to be honest i dnt feel like explaining it riht now so ill probably just paste some screenshots of when i told B about it. I heard a little about ego death. Im gonna learn more about it but from what it sounds like its a way less traumatizig version of what im experiencing. Right now im just tired. I dont want to do anything. I just want to lay down and never worry about life again. I want this to go away. I want to see them again. I want to lay with them and just be held forever. I saw a picture of myself and it looked like someone else. Living feels like a distant memory. Please dpnt smoke weed, it doesnt even do anything. Do heroin instead. I feel like L is getting more and more mad at me every day. We only talk in the mornings now. The other day i was trying to start a conversation with them and they had the most blank stare ive ever seen and barely even looked at me. Their responses were one worded and annoyed, and then they saw their friend and their face lit up and they ran over to them and i just kept walking, i didnt say anything to them after that. Im tired of everyone doing this. People dont like who i am but im not even in my own body 90% of the time so i cant do anything about it. I didnt do anything wrong in the first place. I try to be as neutrl s possible when i look at situations like this and im always able to find something tht i fucked up on and that i need to fix but i really cant this time. I made sarcastic jokes that werent half as fucked up as things they said to me and they got offended by it. Thats not my fault. Im done talking to them. I need to stop letting people that stress me out stay in my life. We either fix it and get over whatever happened or we dot and we move on. I just need to move on. Again. And again.

  I'm really tired. In the last 6 weeks I've almost passed out about 4 or 5 times. Yesterday lasted the longest I think. To anyone thats curious about what dissociation feels like, imagine you're reading a book, its a great book but your mind starts to wander. Your eyes keep reading, but your brain doesnt process a single word and youre jst completely zoned out. Then, you remember youre reading, and you reread the last paragraph and realize its a different book, and you look up and youre in a different house. Everything becomes unfimiliar, when just a few seconds ago you felt amazing. You start to panic, you feel the need to start moving around so you stand up but youre so dizzy you just can't, so you sit on the floor instead and yell for help. You try looking around but everything is still different and new, and it's scary because you lived in this house for years but it never looked as plastic as it does now. Now imagine that happening every week in public places, with no one to yell to yell to for help. I don't think ive mentioned it yet but i started sitting with people. I got tired of sitting allone after B left so iwent to the spot i was at last year for lunch and started hanging out with people there. a couple weeks ago they all started getting realy distant, and one time i had a panic attack before lunch and they asked where i was. a few days ago on friday i sat aloone again and they didn't ask. So starting tomorrow im sitting alone again. I don't belong with them, and i don't think i like having friend anymore. I also told people i was deleting social media for a while, but i just didnt want them to talk to me. Earlier today i really did delete it though and im using a different account most of them don't know about. B keeps bringing up their last relationships and hookups. That's why i deleted everything. Everyone just kept posting about how muhc they love someone and all of their friends, and J always posts pictures of herself crying with some desccription complaining about how she has everything i want in my life but it just desnt work for her. The people id hang out with daily even posted pictures of all of them together without me. So im done with them. I hid all of their accounts so i wouldnt have to see their shit anymore and now they can't even contact me. So thats where i'm at right now. I want it to be summer, I want to see B again, and i really want to go back home. I miss having no one. Being completely alone is somuch better than having everyone you want and still feeling isolated. After being in colorado for last summer, i can see how much better it was than being here. what happened to me. I remember beinf in elementary school. I was so much happier. I wasnt popular, but i hd good friends. better friends than ive had since. so much better. I genuinely enjoyed life, no matter how many days i woke up crying because i didnt want to see a bully at school, or how good it felt to find out that suicide was an option. i was happy. i havent been really happy since. no one was better than anyone then. Now thts all that matters. all life is anymore is a competition to get the most bitches or get more fucked up than anyone else, people are so fucking stupid. The point of life should be enjoying it, not rubbing it in that you have more material things than someone else. And really, what hapened to everyone else too. I wasnt the only one that was happier when i was young. Everyone was. Everyone was exactly like me. Now some people have mre than me, and just cant shut the fuck up about it. In middle school the kids everyone liked and looked up to were the ones drinking lean in class. In elementary school, nothing mattered. All that was ever important was hving fun at recess, which i did along countless times. I made a friend on the first say on kindergarten, now people wont even talk to me. Andits not like im not trying either. I try so fucking hard to be the kind of person someone would want around but everyone actively ignores it. I'm not gonna have any friends in adulthood because of that. I want to feel real. I want to be happy with who i am. I want to feel at home. And the only way i can do that right now is if imcompletely alone. So im done being there for people, im done talking to "friends" that clearly dont want me around no matter how much they try to tell me otherwise, im done trying to talk to people, im done trying to seek validatoin from people worse than me. Im gonna live like its elementary school again. I haven't done a song for the day in a while.

  Kindergarten rules worked surprisingly well. Today was the best day ive had in a while. I didn't feel jealous of the people around me,because no one was around me. I did feel bad wheni made eye contct with the people im avoiding as i walked in the opposite direction from where wed sit. I might still try to sit there from time to time. But not every day. Its too stressful. B is sick again. I feel really bad that i cant help at all. Shes been doing a lot of school wrk lately and today she did like a week of missing stuff. I offered to help but she said it was okay. I miss her a lot. shes been really busy too so we havent talked a ton lately, but im so appy to be talking to her at all. Shes the best person in my life right now. And thats what i told her.

   <p>Deep, Deep, Beneath The Earth, there ley the relms of an old king. I think its m favrite game now. The Shade is my service animal. I cant end the game without getting a sad ending no that 400 days has passed so i just wont end it at all and ill keep him in my pocket for when i need to wander the underground kingdom or read moby dick. ha dick. I should sleep. But i dont feel like it. I wish i ws a shade. I basically m at this point. I have no one to talk to, and nothing to do. I just sit, and thats when i find my peace. And thats when he smiles. But i cant get up and wander endless rooms or caverns with faces in the walls. I get up, and im scared that im not here. And thats it. I decided not to sit alone today, M texted me, but then she left when i got there as shes been doing for a while now. I dont think anyone wil be sitting there anymore except for me and H. I miss B. I miss eating with her and walking around the building looking for a good spot. I miss getting to hug her every day and i miss walking her to her car and i miss going to bed knowing id get to do all of that again the next day. My shade is all i have. Theres no one else that know what my life is like. But it makes me feel hopeless that the best thing in my life right now isnt even real, but then again nthing feels real anymore anyways s i guess it doesnt really matter. The grud breathes when i look at it. I looked at hypoglycemia symptoms today. When i told my dad that i always felt like fainting that was the first thing he thought of since some other family has it i think, and hes ood at guessing disorders so i trust him. But feeling faint is a big part of low blood sugar. But part of me thinks thats not it because i could eat the wrld and still feel this way, and i know for a fact greening out can cause this and thats happened a lot. I dont really want to tell him that though. Idk. Id give everything to be a shade. At least he has his armchair and bookshelf and drawings to look foward to. My stomach does backflips when i walk to my room because one of the last times i did that i almost died, so i just dont really come to my room that much anymore. And im alwys running out of ideas on what to draw. I drew the king earlier. Ill upload it to here wheni figure out how. I wonder why dying scares me so much when it happens, but ive dreamt of killing mself and prayed to every god i dont believe in to make it happen again. I think ill start reading moby dick. Goodnight.

    I think i should tell her i want to die. But thats too much for a casual cnversaition.

So i told B at the beginning of last month how i felt about her, she said she didnt know how she felt as she was having trouble differentiating platonic love and romantic feelings, so i told her that was okay, and to take some time to figure it out and let me know what she decides. Not even a week later, she lets me know by telling me about a girl shes talking to, and how theyre doing all of the same things we did ttogether. So naturally, i didnt talk to her at all for the rest of the night, and the next day i broke down 4 times in class, once in front of her ex, who a few days later she told me she was talking to again. We havent had a full conversation since and she gets here tomorrow. She acts as if im the one that made things awkward, she sends the most limited responses possible and only after several hours, or days, of me texting her first. And i have to see her soon. On a happier note, i got invited to hang out with some people, after i convinced them to invite me, and now i get to take the bus for the first time ever, alone, for an hour, so i can walk around a park with people ive never met in my life, except for one who led me on. But because of whats been happening with B, ive been getting more comfortable with being alone. Im still not used to it, so i dont like it yet, but theres definitely a big weight gone from all the chaos of constantly needing people. Even that weight was essential to my existence. Ive been getting into graffiti. I changed names a few days after a month of using my old one, but this one is more fun to write so i like using it more. Plus now that i know more about graffiti and ive gotten the major parts of my toy shit out of the whay i feel like its kind of a new start. The problem is that i just dont go anywhere, so theres no spots to tag besides whats by my house, which is generally a bad idea and ive already gotten as many spots here as id like. Ive been bored. I started listening to music late at nigh when my thoughts were especially cruel, but now its like a ritual, its the only things that entertains me still even if i just sit and listen to grouper all night. this hurts.
no song for today.

  Things have been weird. For a while i stopped dissociating, for a long time actually. i havent added to this in a long time so theres a lot to catch up on that i dont really remember. ill startwith the end of last school year. i failed a lot of my classes. i passed most of the non electives, except spanish which i did summer school for. last time i wrote was before i started doing graffiti. some time in february or march last year i went out wth some friends and one of them was tagging while we walked, and she gave me a marker and i came up with a shitty tag on the spot and wroteit around. i didnt start doing it again until june or july. probably july. i started with the name clever. B and i both really liked that word and i liked her so i started writing that. later i switched to somatic, though i wrote both for a while. i got a big roll of blank egg shell stickers and id slap em around wherever i walked. i pass them now and i shudder. i got tired of somatic. in late july i went to colorado for the summer and i started talking to s again. we were together for 2 months. shes a canadian native and speaks ojibwe and taight me the wonderful sentence "gi muzhiway ina". i started writing muzh, which i still do. muzh for throwies and pieces, muzhiway for tags. anyways, s and i were together. after i fell head over heels for b, and landed on my teeth and ate shit, we didnt really talk as much, but s was still worried i liked her more. i really did try, but after everything she had already done i couldnt handle it. i got back here on august 30th, and we broke up on september 14th or 18th. september 8th was b's birthday. it was only us and 2 other people i had never met before. they all seemed closer with each other, and they were. again. they had all known each other for years before i came along.one of the people she invited though, SB, was really nice and trying to involve me more. it was before S and i broke up but i knew i liked her a little. i didnt tell myself that, but i knew. if i admitted to myself that i liked her then, then i wouldve felt worse about S. about a week later was homecoming. I went with B and SB, we stayed for an hour and they danced at me while i made origami flowers. then we left and went to the park by the school. we sat there swinging and listening to music for another hour before we went home. i broke up with s that night. she did the usual "you make me feel horrible i hate you and i never want to see you again, but i love you please dont leave" and i said "im sorry, were just both not happy". i acted so sad, but i couldnt wait to be away. SB and i started hanging out alone, she made me watch the entire twilight series. i had to have a bucket for when i threw up because of the shitty acting. she started coming over every week. halloween was my first kiss, we had just finished the five nights at freddys movie. we stood outside the theater and we hugged for a while and she stepped back and looked at me, and just went for it. i was too nervous to do it myself. if you saw her you wouldnt blame me. weve been together since with no issues. at one point s reached out to me, right when she had started dating. i had given SB my sweater a few days before halloween. s texted me begging to not leave her, when i already had. she told me things theres no way she would know without stalking SB or seeing us in person. i still watch my back sometimes because of that. i told SB immediately. there was no jealousy, no begging, no manipulation, just "thats okay, thanks for letting me know". i think that was in october. our third month together is in 4 days.

  All of that being said, since SB and i have been together, ive been dissociating more. i noticed that being in the dark is a big trigger for it. if i look around in the dark for too long i cant breathe, and i just start running to any room that has light in it. ive never been afraid in the dak, ive never been comfortable in it either, but ive never been so scared that i had to run from it until recently. i use a flashlight in my house every night. for a while i felt like i was going insane, and i still do sometimes. i lose moments sometimes. im so used to being on autopilot that i wont remember big parts of the day. sometimes ill just randomly "wake up" and have no idea what just happened. its different from a blackout though, some of it is still there. i just do things, i dont have to think about it. it scared me at first, but now it just happens.

  anyways, im bored. thats all for tonight.

</p>

<p> 1/22/24
Tomorrow itll be the 23rd. 1+23=24. I wish i was better about things like. I can never find one hobby to stick with. Every time i told my family i was bored when i was growing up theyd say smart people dont get bored, but its really the opposite. Smart people get bored more than anyone else. Stupid people are the ones entertained by everything. Smart people are understimulated because simple things mean nothing to them. I dont feel smart, but i get bored. I need to learn to be okay with knowing im not gonna make it. My gpa is 2.0 and im noton track to graduate unless im a super senior, which id rather kill myself. So really i should just look into gettingmy GED. Who the fuck fails high school. Everyone has their diploma. I dont just get bored of hobbies or routines though, i get bored of the people around me. Muqtada had it right. Like when you think about it i really fuck everything up. Im wired to fail. I cant be entertained by the things ive loved forever, so obviously im not gonna just wake up and pass a math test at 8 in the morning. I cant even sit and read my favorite book, theres nothing i want to draw, theres no melodies i wasnt to write, theres no games i want to make, theres no movies i want to watch, theres no stories i want to write, because im wired to be bored. And the problem is since ive had so many hobbies, my family thinks im a supergenius, when really i cant do shit, and i just disappoint them. i disappoint my friends too when out of nowhere i just dont care about them anymore, at the very least. but thats on a good day. on a bad day i hate them. thats why i act the way i do around my friends. i tell them about my shitty grades and just generally act retarded because theyre all lightyears ahead of me, so i dont want it to be a surprise when i fall behind them. I used to want to work at naughty dog as an environment designer and then i quickly learned that nothing good ever comes from me trying to make games, i dont know why i keep trying. honestly i think the most ive learned from trying new things, is that im just not all that good at actually doing them. im great at trying, and when i cando something im great at starting, but i dont think ive ever actually finish a project. andit sucks because when theres something you really want to do, that youll stop at nothing to finish, so you can see it done exactly the way you imagined it, and then you lose motivation and shut it all down, it really makes you wonder what the fuck you could ever actually do with your life. i really have nothing going for me. im gonna be one of those people thats always getting new jobs and ill have to leech off my partner because ill never actually have a steady paycheck, and thats assuming i prostitute myself to the diploma fairy. id be lucky to even have that life. i might go back and read the earlier stuff on here. i wanna see how past me is doing.

</p>

<p> 
just got head.
:Bitch Please:
</p>

<p>
honestly i have trouble reading the older parts of this. you can tell I was an edgy middle schooler. Ireally dont like who I was then and im glad I'm better now. I treated everyone so badly, and I was so pissed all the time. I was so negative but I told myself I was just being realistic but now I can see that there's good parts in everything and there's nothing unrealistic about that. it's finals week, bio made me cry
    we only had 2 days to learn the one thing out final exam is about and one of those days was a half day and they were a full week apart. I just sat and cried all class and when my teacher asked for the test I just said I didn't know how to do it and she said okay and took it and walked away
    I dont really wanna go back there. tomorrow I have my math test, which I havwnt atudied for at all and it's my first period, so I should bring tissues. this is why I don't listen to people when they compliment my intelligence. because them I say that my grades don't show it and they say grades arent representative of intelligence anyways and then they get upset that I'm not on track to graduate but they keep saying I so smart when I literally cry in class at least once a month because I just don't know how to do anything. anyways, I don't like to spend my free time thinming about school, or my class time for that matter. so I'm gonna finish my soda and jerk off and fall asleep watching the office. also I'm bringing back the song thing.

my dreams are getting too vivid. on top of finals week, this morning I woke up and immediately had a panic attack. we had a week off and it fucked my sleep schedule so I've been going to bed around 3 or 4 and getting up around 6. I've been so exhausted every day and I always have vivid dreams when I nap. yesterday I fell asleep in class I had a dream that I finished the school day and went home and sat for a few hours in my room before going to bed. when I went to bed, I woke up in class, not even half way done with the day. when I did finally get home I sat in my room for a couple hours and went to bed and when I fell asleep I dreamed that I woke up in class.

    when I woke up this morning my room looked like it had shifted, and minutes would just disappear. I started listening to music so I could keep track of how much time I was losing. between getting out of the car andgsitting down in my class there was about 2 or 3 minutes that I dont remember at all, but I remember the song I listened to during those few minutes. it's more than zoning out now.
    
    :Goodnight, God Bless, Love U, Delete:

<p> 2/1/24
I just found some pills in one of my class rooms. it was in a weird container so I grabbed it and theres 2 white capsules inside. a lot of pills are white capsules but im gonna try to find something on them

ive been thinking about this a lot today, I've never really had a friend group. nit since elementary school at least. once that ended I never had a group of friends. I had acquaintances that all had friend groups but I was never part of it. yesterday during a field trip, someone I consider one of my closer friends made it clear that we're not really that close. idk. its sad. when I was younger one of the things I wanted mist was 3 or 4 close friends with similar interests that I could talk to anything about. now I have SB but thats it. an I love her but I want more than one friend. especially when she talks so much about how amazing her friends are. I dont like her friends. I don't like mine. I was so much closer with people when I first came here. it's weird. the time I knew people best was when I first met them, and now that I really know them they've all drifted off. and all I wanted was to have them in my life. I can't even reach out to the friends I lived so much in elementary school. it really was perfect then. I'm tired of wasting so much time being sad when everything around me is so beautiful. it's comforting though. feeling shitty gives me a reason to keep going.this week has been so exhausting. I really have no reason to be happy. and im not. I have no friends besides my girlfriend, who does make me happy but I also have my unattachment issues that make me feel shitty, I have no passion for anything I do in my life except big projects that will never see the light if day, for example, since I was young I always wanted to play dungeons and dragons with my friends. I bought all this stuff for the game and spend all this money on it even when I had no friends to play with. it's all sat in my closet for years. I have a friend from middle school that I made a ttrpg with, and I still spend hours working on new ideas for it. we started it in 2019. we've never played it before and I've rewritten the rules at least 5 times and I've worked on the project for 5 years. no one will play this. no one will know it's name. no one will ask me about it. no one will help me make it. I do it for me, so I can distract myself with the hope that one day I'll have put years of effort into something that'll be warmly enjoyed among a group of tightly knit friends. but its just a hope. I am inhabited by a cry. theres too many white capsules to be able to know what I found today.
</p>

<p>
there have been multiple times where I've held a gun with the intention of killing myself. once at a wedding, I went to the car to get something from the glove box and there was a pistol there. I just sat and held it until I saw my brother walk up to the car and I put it back. the second time I was home alone, I went into my parents room and took a gun out of the nightstand and just sat and held it again. I guess j didn't have the intention of killing myself, it was more of a reality check or soemthinf. it's insane how unreal life feels when you're an inch away from ending it. I put it back and went to my room to play games


today in class I wrote an essay on why the American school system is failing. I'm not trying to throw shade at the teachers, but it is kinda their fault. it's literally their job.

    Fixing people's educations isn't a matter of taking phones away. I know better than most, that if im bored my mind will find a a way. I'll admit that ot makes me sad to see so many people, including myself, relying on their phones for everything. In the last year, I am the first and only person I've I've read a book. I don't even like reading. While I read or draw in class when im bored, others play Clash Of clans on their phones for the entire period. This isnt only an issue with phones, as people will find other ways to entertain themselves, and they'll just want to be there less if they get their phones taken away. This is an issue with teachers as well.
The best teacher I ever had was named Mr kreider. He was my 4th grade teacher and still remains my favorite of all time, even in my junior year. Mr. Kreider was energetic, engaging, had interactive methods of teaching, and overall you could tell he loved his job. He didnt care about the pay, he just wanted to help kids learn. He was strict, but fair, and very kind. He helped anyone individually and as a result knew the students more personally and could put more effort into adapting to everyone's learning style.
I've never been good in school, not even in that class. I'm happy with getting Cs and Ds, I have to plans to go to college because none of the jobs I want require me to. 
Now even with my grades, you can see a noticeable difference between teachers like Kreider, and the teachers I currently have. My math teacher was very similar to him. She was loud, but very helpful. When a student needed help, she sat down next to them and helped with whatever they needed. She would have many short breaks throughout the class and we would play small breaks during them, and if we won we could get candy for it. It was a good way to motivate and get students to work together. Because if this, students weren't afraid to ask her, or other students for help. And even though the class was silent most of the time, it never stopped someone from getting help in that class. Everyone passed this class, and for me it was the first I got a B in any math class I've taken.
My current teacher is quiet, doesnt help students individually, her lessons aren't engaging in any way, and generally it seems like she doesn't want to be there. Students don't interact with others in the room at all, very few ever ask questions. Many people skip this class or look at their phones, and less than 50 percent of her 200 students are currently passing.
When a student is bored, they'll look at their phone, skip, sleep. And yes, it's the students job to stay engaged, but its the teachers job to be engaging. Students can't be expected to learn, when the teachers have no passion, and the entire education system is clearly not for learning, but for getting good test scores. As amazing as my math teacher was last year, I dont remember anything we did, but I remember a lot about my 4th grade class because my teacher didn't teach so we could get good grades, he taught so we could learn. No one was afraid to ask questions because the class was a community, which the teacher pulled together. I've seen the people in my classes every day for a half a year, and I've never said a word to most of them. It's the teachers job to pull the class together and make us more comfortable with each other, its the teachers job so be engaging, it's the teachers job to teach something the students feel is worth learning by showing practical ways to use the information theyre teaching, and most importantly it's the teachers job to teach not for grades, but to learn, and to remember what we learned for years of our lives.

    Been a while. I want to start writing more as like a warm up for my brain when i wake up. Maybe not in this case because its 4AM. I've been playing games with K again. Idk if i ever mentioned that i would do that. On halloween of 2021, i spent the whole night by myself and it was really sad, but i texted K and we played a game together for a while and i was okay again. Its hard to know whats new when i dont remember what was happening the last time i wrote here. I dont think id started house of leaved by then. I finished it last week and bought a new hardcover copy today. It really fucked me up but i was tired of being curious so i read the last 300 pages in a few days. My classes are shit this year. the formatting is awful still and i didnt get any of the ones i wanted (though my options were limited because we could only pick from the boring required classes). I have this one class that only talks about racism. its basically just "youre racist, your holidays are racist, everything is racist, its your fault as a lower class high school student with no job or drivers license that the government operates the way it does and supresses those less fortunate than you". Speaking of which, i havent talked to E in months because we had a political argument. This is exactly why i dont talk about politics with anyone. Everyone thinks theyre right. ooh. everyone has the mentality of "you are entitled to my opinion," as if everyones opinion isnt stupid to anyone else on the planet. Now we have France doing womens rights protests for america. You know its bad here when france wants to help. Ive been bored lately. Im getting a new book soon after i read dune, dune messiah, and house of leaves. Ive read more books this year than any year before. rap. Im still working through clas of kings, though with a better pace, not that it means much. It took my a year to read 100 pages, then a few weeks to read another 300. I read dune messiah in a week and i wanted to keep that flow. Its been slowing down but ive grown to love books a lot more. I started writing more too. Ive had a lot of story ideas. Theyre probably the only thing occupying the otherwise empty space in my head, besides whatever neurotransmitters make me laugh after I fart. i. I started using my ps vita more. All in all ive had a lot of ways to occupy my mind, but i still get bored. I dont think itll go away. I havent had a real hyperfixation in a long time now. With more books on the way, hopefully thatll fix itself for a while. ya. Oh yeah, i made my first dollar off of my music. It was actually 2 dollars. The guy bought 2 beats and im still convinced it was an accident. I've been with my girlfriend for over a year now. After years of entries pining after girls that would enc up rejecting me soon after i learned their name, only for me to never talk to them again, finally i got one that said yes. she sad yes before i did though. She asked me out first. But i bet if i had been the ffirst to make a move, she still wouldve said no. Just my luck. I feel better when i write like this. Winter is coming. Another long, depressing, dark period of time. Literall dark. It's pitch black by 5pm, constantly raining. It's a good thing i walk to and from school, right? the world would end if i didnt have to walk through the needles of freezing rain and winds cold and sharp enough to not only make my sack shrivel up, but to cut it clean off. It's so cold im becoming a girl. It would be a shame if someone could drive me for 2 minutes up the street. I could also get my icense, but the roads here are about 3 inches wide and the drivers that inhabit it are angry meteors that thing theyre grains of sand drifting by in a breeze. Theyre so impatiant. In the span of 3 minutes in my girlfriends car, 2 people almost hit us, and 2 people failed to use their blinkers multiple times. In fact, were nearly t boned at least twice a month because someone runs a stop sign. And people tell me to get my license? absolutely fucking not. Ill get it when i live in a state thats bright enough to see the road without my brights on the sunniest day of the year. Anyway, its almost 420 now. Im tired and i still want to draw, so im going to do that and go to sleep.

    My girlfriend just said to me "I love you, and i wish you loved me the same". What the fuck am i supposed to do with the rest of my night. For context, i got no sleep last night. My sleep schedules been fucked, so i stayed up to reset it. My girlfriend comes over and immediately falls asleep and stays asleep for about 2 hours knowing that if i go to sleep i wont be tired when i need to be, and staying up for so long will have been for nothing. During the time shes asleep i sat and stared, listened to the entirety of Ohms, and found out that the files for a personal project i had sunk a non-stop 8 hours into the night before had been irreversably corrupted. She wakes up, gets mad that i dont give her attention when im sleep deprived and pissed, she fucks me, then goes home and barely says a word. The second she walks out the door i get her text. "I wish you loved me the same," ans "I practically have to beg for any love," And she says it as if she is unaware of how my brain works. A part of autism is that if im not actively talking to someone or doing an activity with them, theyre basically not there. Its not their fault, its not my fault, its just how it is and she knows this. I also CAN NOT give something constant attention and get nothing back. I dont get satisfaction from holding someones hand and doing nothing else for 3 hours when i could be draawing and listening to music in that time, or any activity where theres an outcome similar. I can't explain it in a way that doesnt make me sound like an asshole. But she sits there for hours looking at her phone, and i draw or play games or listen to music or make games or make music, and she starts crying because i was supposed to be giving her constant attention, that she never even made it clear she wanted because she seemed find just doing her own thing. I bet I seem like a pretty huge dick for not being able to read people's minds.
